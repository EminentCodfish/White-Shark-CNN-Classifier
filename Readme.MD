## White Shark CNN Classifier

In partnership with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy (AWSC; https://www.atlanticwhiteshark.org/), the goal of this project was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify white sharks in videos.  The AWSC collected videos of white sharks around Cape Cod as part of a long-term population study.  This model is designed to expedite the processing of these videos to isolate the relevent frames with contain white shark images.
